This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to optional properties.  The `printName` function expects an object with a `firstName` and an optional `lastName`.  While the code compiles without errors, it fails when an object is passed that is missing the `lastName` property, but has other additional properties. This example highlights the importance of careful type handling and error checking, particularly when dealing with optional properties in TypeScript.
